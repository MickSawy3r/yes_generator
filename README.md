# yes_generator
Generator for Yes Soft Skeleton Modules

## Notes.
For now this is a global node package.
To make this tool complete it should be translated into dart.
which is something I don't know how to do at this moment.

## Usage
Install it and use it :smile:

```bash
yarn global add dart-module-generator # If you use yarn
npm i -g dart-module-generator # If you don't

```

And then use it.

```bash
yes-generate  g test
```

This command generate a full module from it.
Up next, auto load for all modules into the app automatically :fireworks:
